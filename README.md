# Chess
Fun project for my spare time and to learn about OOD.

## GOALS

### To learn about object oriented design through a fun game

### To experiment with elements of AI such as:
* Decision trees, using pruning algorithm called Alpha-Beta
* Plans to implement a faster sorting algorithm, maybe Quick Sort

### To familiarize myself with the principles of chess engine design, like:
 * Bitboards versus mailbox addressing
 * Depth searching and static evaluation
